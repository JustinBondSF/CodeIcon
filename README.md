# CodeIcon
I was searching for an icon that represented programming and looked decent, only to find that they are all either &lt;/>, an impression of a text editor, the word "code" stylized, or some variation thereof. So I decided to make my own icon. I think it looks pretty good. The iconography conveys power, work, and skill, while also attempting to avoid any political connotations a raised fist with a wrench might evoke, mainly due to the soft angles. The curly braces make it distinctly programming related. Feel free to use it in your project, with or without attribution (but I'd think it was nice if you gave me shout üòÅ)
